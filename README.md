# canvarorg-v2

This code is not a final product. 
It is only used for test purpose.
Here, we are testing the new interface components and back-end functionalities of our web-based database, canvaruk.
The version 2 is still under development, however you can still access to its stable version (v1) at [www.canvaruk.org](canvaruk.org).

For any queries related to canvaruk.org (all versions) please contact with the team of [Professor Clare Turnbull](https://www.icr.ac.uk/our-research/researchers-and-teams/professor-clare-turnbull)

You may need [reduced.sql](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ljd-rr1fIIhWUN5LlJ1s8aqdk-kwDZK0/view?usp=sharing) to test the results of the queries.
